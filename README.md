# Advent of Code 2025 - Solutions in Lean

As of this repo's creation, I have just started learning [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). 
As means to practise some of the language's basics, I decided to try solving (some of the) [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) exercises.

## Running the solutions
You can install Lean4 (and its toolchain) by following [the official instructions](https://lean-lang.org/install/). Then, simply load this repo in your editor of choice, open any of the `DayXX.lean` modules and hover over the `#eval ...` commands found within the module, which call the functions that solve the exercises.

Alternatively, feel free to play around with the functions defined in any of the modules in the [online Lean playground](https://live.lean-lang.org/), and using `#eval` to call any of the functions. 

`#eval` is my new Lord, and I am dedicating 15 minutes of prayer to it every morning 😌
(I wish Haskell had something like this!)

## Disclaimer
These solutions are not meant to represent idiomatic code or best practices in any way. 
In fact, some of the things I will do **knowing** they are not necessary or straightforward (and some will be **unknowingly**; I'm learning!).
This repository is a mere playground, and any code within it should be regarded as sandcastles.
